    <p>I spent many months and a lot of blood doing my part in the sweeping, epic saga <b><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_%28film_series%29">The Lord of the Rings</a></b></i>. Now <i>that</i> was a big, meaty tale that deserved three long movies. Lots of good and evil. Huge battles all over the place. Ghost horses with nightmare riders. Sorcerers. Walking trees. Hords of orcs. A floating, fire-laden eye. And of course that creepy ring I had to carry around. Sam and I even had to spend weeks with Gollum, the nasty little bugger who eventually bit off my finger. While I saved the world, I came out of the whole thing pretty weak and soul-sick. Still, you have to admit the three movies were pretty satisfying.</p>
    
    <p> So what happens once LOR is a success? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson">Director Peter Jackson</a> tries to make some other movies that mostly flop. (Like his remake of <b><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_%282005_film%29">King Kong</a></b></i>, anyone? I didn't think so.) New Line Cinema&mdash;which backed the original movies&mdash;wants more money. Somebody recruits my Uncle Bilbo. And voila, we've got <i>The Hobbit</i> ready for filming.</p>

    <p>Let's face it, <b><i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_hobbit">The Hobbit</a></b></i> is a good book. It's a nice tale with some good imagery, a nasty dragon, a few battles, and plenty of dwarves and goblins. But it's just one medium-size book. It looks like a cute little dumpling compared to the big roast beef that is the three tomes of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> saga. I can't think of any reason except greed (and a lack of scruples) to turn that dumpling into three separate movies. Jackson came up with plots and subplots out of thin air. He tries to manufacture drama all over the place. It's just insane. And poor Bilbo was already under contract, so he really didn't have a choice once he saw what they were planning on doing.</p>

    <p>OK, I'm out of here. Rant over. It's time for second breakfast. And those elves know how to cook!</p>

    <p><i>1. Note: I know this exercise was to make a personal page, which I promise to do later in the class. (In fact a showpiece web site is one of my main goals.) But in the interest of getting something done quickly with enough detail, I thought this would be sufficient. - Joel</i></p>
